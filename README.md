My entire dev environment, since I've been setting up my dev environment on various machines lately.

I use the *vim-ags* Silver Searcher plugin for Vim, so the Silver Seacher will need to be installed on your machine for this to work. Instructions on how to do this for your distro can be found in [the official repository](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher).

## Installation

First, I hope you cloned with `git clone --recursive`, otherwise you can install them by pulling with the `--recurse-submodules` flag. This is for the vim plugins which are included in this repository as submodules.


The following utilities are required for this env as well:
```
brew install git bash-completion ag
```
